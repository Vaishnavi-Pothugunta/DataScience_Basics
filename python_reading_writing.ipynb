    "# Writing Text Files\n",
    "One of the most commonly performed data processing tasks is to read data from a file, manipulate it in some way, and then write the resulting data out to a new data file to be used for other purposes later. To accomplish this, the open function discussed above can also be used to create a new file prepared for writing. Note in Table 1 that the only difference between opening a file for writing and opening a file for reading is the use of the 'w' flag instead of the 'r' flag as the second parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with that name is created and made ready to accept our data. If an existing file has the same name, its contents are overwritten. As before, the function returns a reference to the new file object."
